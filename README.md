# Hateval

Took a lead role in developing a Hate Speech detection model using SVM binary classifier. Implemented data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training using scikit-learn. Conducted rigorous 10-fold cross-validation, showcasing strong proficiency in machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

### Step 1 : import all the following from the list

		- from sklearn import svm, model_selection
		- import numpy as np
		- import pandas as pd
		- from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

### Step 2 : Create a folder Hateval, Save the Hateval.ipynb in the same folder along with the following files 

		- hateval.tsv

### Step 3 : Run the Jupyter Notebook Server by just typing “jupyter notebook” on terminal.


### Step 4 : Open the folder Hateval and Run the Hateval.ipynb
